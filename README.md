### REGISTER NUMBER : 25014856
AIM

To write prompts for the following prompt types and evaluate them using a suitable method:

Straightforward Prompts

Tabular Format Prompting

Preceding Question Prompting

Missing Word Prompting

Explanation

This experiment aims to understand and apply various prompting techniques to improve the quality and clarity of AI-generated responses.
Using one use case from Unit 5 (e.g., “Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare”), prompts are created and tested using the four Unit 2 prompt types mentioned above.

The goal is to analyze how different prompt structures influence the accuracy, clarity, and depth of AI-generated responses.

Use Case (from Unit 5):

Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare

Procedure
1. Straightforward Prompts

These prompts directly request specific information without additional context or structure.

Examples:

“Explain one application of Artificial Intelligence in healthcare.”

“List three ways AI is improving medical diagnosis.”

Response (Evaluation Example):
AI helps healthcare by enabling faster and more accurate diagnosis using medical imaging, predictive analysis, and personalized treatment recommendations.

Evaluation:
✅ Accurate, simple, but limited in depth.

2. Tabular Format Prompting

Used to generate structured information in table form for comparison or classification.

Prompt:
“Create a table comparing three applications of AI in healthcare — Diagnosis, Drug Discovery, and Patient Monitoring — with their descriptions and benefits.”

Response (Example):

Application	Description	Benefits
Diagnosis	AI systems analyze X-rays and MRI scans to detect diseases.	Faster and more accurate detection of conditions.
Drug Discovery	AI models predict molecular behavior and new drug interactions.	Reduces research cost and time.
Patient Monitoring	Wearable devices collect real-time data analyzed by AI.	Enables early warning and remote care.

Evaluation:
✅ Highly organized, easy to interpret, and well-structured output.

3. Preceding Question Prompting

This technique uses a leading or contextual question followed by a related task, helping the model generate deeper reasoning-based answers.

Prompt:
“Why is AI becoming essential in healthcare? Explain how machine learning models assist in detecting diseases at an early stage.”

Response (Example):
AI is becoming essential in healthcare because it can analyze vast datasets quickly. Machine learning models detect disease patterns, such as early signs of cancer or heart disease, using patient data and imaging scans, which helps doctors make faster and more accurate decisions.

Evaluation:
✅ Provides clear reasoning and depth; suitable for conceptual explanations.

4. Missing Word Prompting

This technique helps test factual knowledge and recall by leaving blanks in statements.

Prompts:

“AI systems in healthcare analyze patient data to predict ____.”

“The use of AI in analyzing medical images helps detect ____ at an early stage.”

Responses:

“AI systems in healthcare analyze patient data to predict diseases.”

“The use of AI in analyzing medical images helps detect cancer at an early stage.”

Evaluation:
✅ Simple and effective for factual recall or fill-in-the-blank tasks.

Conclusion

All four prompt types were applied to the chosen use case (AI in Healthcare) successfully.
Each prompting method showed distinct characteristics:

Straightforward Prompts gave short and precise answers.

Tabular Format Prompting improved clarity and organization.

Preceding Question Prompting enhanced depth and reasoning.

Missing Word Prompting was effective for testing factual understanding.

Thus, prompt structure greatly influences response quality, completeness, and clarity in AI-generated text.

Result: The various types of prompts were executed successfully, and the report was generated as required.
✅ Thus, the prompts were executed successfully.
